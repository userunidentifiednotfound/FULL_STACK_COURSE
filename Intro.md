# Introduction to HTML

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. HTML forms the backbone of the World Wide Web, enabling the creation and formatting of documents that can be viewed on the internet by web browsers.

HTML documents are comprised of a series of **elements**, which are enclosed within angle brackets, known as **tags**. These tags define the **structure** and **content** of the document.

## ✨ Features of HTML

- ✅ Very easy and simple language.
- ✅ Platform-independent: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.
- ✅ Being a markup language, it provides a flexible way to design web pages.
- ✅ Supports form creation (e.g., login forms, surveys, checkout processes).
- ✅ HTML is **case-insensitive** (`<h1>` and `<H1>` are treated the same).
- ✅ Can be combined with CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- `<head>` and `<body>` tags are **children** of the `<html>` tag.
- `<html>` is the **parent** of `<head>` and `<body>`.
- Save files with `.html` or `.htm` extensions.
- Use browser tools like **Inspect Element** or **View Page Source** to explore HTML code of web pages.
- **HTML Element** = Start tag + content + End tag
